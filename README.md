# elite102project

Code for the Elite 102 Banking App Project

NOTES:

- If the code is run from main.py, all CLI functions should work as intended.
- If the code is fun from userinterface.py, all functions should run when the buttons are clicked, but further interaction is done through the terminal through CLI.
  - Functions also do not always work as intended, but functionality still exists.
- Functions tested in testing.py are the log in and transaction functions. Other functionality has been tested other ways, however the most crucial being these three.
